## About
Vuelto is a game engine built with GLFW and OpenGL using C++. My goal is to achieve a good and easy to use game engine for everyone. I am currently working on the engine, and I am not planning to releasing Vuelto (its not ready). I am planning to release a website for the engine that contains a documentation for the engine and a roadmap/changelog. I am also planning to release a couple of tutorials on how to use vuelto. I hope you will enjoy using vuelto. Have fun!
